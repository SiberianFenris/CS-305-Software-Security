# CS-305-Software-Security

- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

My client, Artemis Financial, is a financial institution that was looking to incorporate additional security into their already existing application.

- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I enjoyed getting to use static testing to find potential discrepencies and vulnerabilities. Secure coding is important to protect not only your data but the data of your userbase and employees. Personal identifying information and even secret information can cause harm to both people and businesses. It's our job as developers to think about that risk when creating a solution.

- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found the Maven dependency check tool to be the most helpful. It can not only help inform you about possible vulnerabilities but it gives you a way to know how to make your application safer without having to sift through everything manually.

- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

While testing, I had noticed that most of the vulnerabilities were caused by old libraries. Updating the libraries in the application to ones that are the most up-to-date makes the application more secure software. I would use more static, dynamic and even penetration testing to try to find weakpoints in my application that could put data and customers at risk.

- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I continually ran debugs to ensure that my code was functional and met requirements. After refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used Stack Overflow, Discord, and YouTube videos quite a bit throughout this term. I also checked how others approached this and compared that to what I had done then refactored some parts of my approach.

- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would say either the use of my hash function to encrypct communication or my ability to not only create a keystore and certificate but also make it secure.
